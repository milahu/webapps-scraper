Is there an AI that can scrape a web application and output a standalone replica of it? I know there are website duplication apps but what about for applications?

---

If I understand the question correctly, itâ€™s about creating a website/API that will be filled with data that will be continuously fetching from the web and processed.

The question is quite extensive - depending on the programming language, there may be different options. Using the example of Python, an approximate scheme could be:

1) Create a program / script that does web scraping. For example with Scrapy or requests/lxml etc.

2) Design a database structure for the data that will be retrieved in the process of web scraping. For example, with PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

3) Create a web application based on the framework (with Flask or Django), which will take data from the database and return them in the form of an API or a simple web pages.

4) Implement the background task queues to be run continuously or periodically. Launching webspider , data processing, saving to database, all required tasks for handling data - with Celery + Redis Queue. If you need, there are additional tools needed for analysis and wrangling data (Pandas, NLTK and other libraries and frameworks).

5) (Optional but desirable). Create a monitoring and logging system for the webspider, if something goes wrong in the process of web scraping. With built-in module logging or others.

6) Deploy and configure web stack and enviroment on the server (Linux distro (Ubuntu Server etc), web server (Apache or Nginx), wsgi server (Gunicorn), database server (PostgreSQL or MongoDB), Python enviroment with all dependencies (frameworks, libs, your scripts)).

pywb toolkit is full-featured, advanced web archiving capture and replay framework for python. It provides command-line tools and an extensible framework for high-fidelity web archive access and capture, including localization and access control. A subset of features provides the basic functionality also known as a 'wayback machine', but pywb includes additional features to create new web archives and to manage existing collections.
